1) (Part A) Numpy_NN 

This notebook consists of the following implemented using Numpy:

- 3 layer neural network 
- 2 variable based non linear equation(quadratic non linear equation)
- also 3 variable based non linear equation(cubic non linear equation)
- Relu for non-linear activation function, implemented chain rule based gradient propagation
- used appropriate number of neurons and epochs
