Demonstrated the following in this assignment :

a) Demonstrate how convolution layers themselves work visually in colab

b) implement depth wise pooling layer in keras and demonstrate its use

c) 

Part 2:

Three colabs with  vision classifiers - data  - mnist, fashion mnist and cifar 10

 

demonstrate for each colab :

a) use simple neural network as well as lenet-5  - two architectures

 

b) demonstrate pretrained model with transfer learning  (both efficient net and BiT)

c) Demonstrate imge augmentation 

d) demonstrate with state of art image models - mlp-mixer

 

Part 3:

a) Xray pnemonea classification with convnet : In this colab, I have built an X-ray image classification model to predict whether an X-ray scan shows presence of Pneumonia using the CNN model architecture

b) 3d image classication of ctscan : In this colab, I have built a 3d convolutional neural network inorder to predict the presence of Pneumonia in CTScan images. These 3d convolutional neural networks can be used to prcoess RGB images, by taking 3d volume or sequence of 2d frame as input.
