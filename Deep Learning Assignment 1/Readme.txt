Part 1: Blackbox deep learning - Fast AI

i) Image classification : Used fast AI library vision learner to perform image classification.
Colabs:

Dataset obtained Using duckduckgo api :

ii) Segmentation : used unet_learner model to perform segmentation, where the model we create can recognize every pixel of an image.

iii) Text classifier : using text classifier to perform NLP, identify sentiment is positive or negative in a text. Tried this a variety of different text data.

iv) Tabular data loaders : we use CSV input, build a model and make classifications/predictions on the tabular data given. I have done this for a couple of datasets where we classify salary as >50k or <50k, and a citrus data set where we classify as orange/grapefruit

v) Recommendation : Collab learner is used to perform recommendations. Based on ratings data which loaded as a CSV.
