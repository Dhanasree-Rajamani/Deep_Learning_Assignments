I have used tensorflow in the colab, and used Custom ML components for tasks such as Fashion MNIST.

Created and used the following custom components :

a) Saving/Loading Models with Custom Objects : used this to save and load models and custom objects

b) Custom loss function : used custom loss function to define a custom way to measure model performance

c) custom regularizer : Used this to prevent model's weights from overfitting by applying penalty to model weights

d) custom activation funtion : using a custom activation function to introduce non-linearity in the model output

e) custom initializer : using this as a custom way to set the initial values of model's weights

f) custom kernel constraint : used this to apply a specific constraint to the model's weights during training
 
g) custom seed : using a custom seed to reproduce the results of the model

h) custom metrics : using custom metrics to evaluate the model's performance during training and testing

i) custom callback : using custom callback to perform specific actions during training - such as saving the model weights, visualize performance of model 

j) custom layer : using this to specify a specificcustom functionality

k) custom model : using custom model to define custom architecture for the model

l) custom gradient : used to define specific gradient calculation

m) custom training loop : using this to specify the training procedure for the model

n) custom  tf functions : are used to perform operations that are not avilable in built in library

o) custom optimizer :  used to define a custom optimization algorithm

p) custom dropout : used thisto implement regularization by randomly dropping out certain nodes during training 

q) custom regularizer : Used this to prevent model's weights from overfitting by applying penalty to model weights

r) custom learning rate scheduler : using this to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training - based on performance of the model
